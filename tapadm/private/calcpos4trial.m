function [Result, Residuals, Iterations] = calcpos4trial(Result, Residuals, Iterations, Amps, FirstPointNo, LastPointNo, Channel, StartPoint, Options,  DispFunc, DispArg);
% CALCPOS4TRIAL calculates sensor positions and orientations from amplitudes.
%           The function computes a whole trial or a trial segment on a
%           given data structure. The first three arguments Result,
%           Residuals and Iterations are returned after calculating values
%           for the segment between FirstPointNo and LastPointNo and the
%           given Channel. If StartPoint is singleton, the segment is processed 
%           from FirstPointNo to LastPointNo (First may be greater than
%           Last) using the predecessor as start value for the calculation.
%
%           If StartPoint is a vector, it's elements are taken as individual 
%           start values. (In the order the segment is processed.) 
%
%           [Result, Residuals, Iterations] = calcpos4trial(Result, Residuals, 
%                                              Iterations, Amps, FirstPointNo, 
%                                              LastPointNo, Channel, StartPoint, Options);
%
%           The function returns the Nx7 matrix 'Result' with amplitudes for every
%           spatial point (row) and transmitter (column), plus 'rms-value'
%           plus exit condition (column 7):
